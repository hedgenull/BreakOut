# BreakOut

Python version of Atari Breakout game.
_*NOTICE*_: "Minor" bugs (as follows):
- When the ball hits the side of the bar, it starts going about Mach 10. I know WHY this happens but can't fix it.
- The bricks do not reappear when they are all destroyed.
If you spot any other bugs, please report them.
