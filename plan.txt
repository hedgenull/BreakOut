Breakout plan:

[1. Create bar and make it move with arrow keys.]
2. Create ball and make it bounce off of objects.
3. Create bricks.
4. Make bricks disappear when hit with the ball.
5. Make the ball disappear when it goes off the screen.
6. Add a scoring system (points, increasing point values, high score, etc.).
7. Make the game move faster and faster. Make a certain amount of expendable balls.
8. Different ball types? Different bricks? Sound? Brick arrangements?
