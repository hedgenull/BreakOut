Breakout plan:

[1. Create bar and make it move with arrow keys.]
[2. Create ball and make it bounce off of objects.]
[3. Create bricks.]
[4. Make bricks disappear when hit with the ball.]
[5. Make the ball disappear when it goes off the screen.]
[6. Add a scoring system (points, increasing point values, high score, etc.).]
[7. Make the game move faster and faster. Make a certain amount of expendable balls.]
[8. Different ball types? Different bricks? Sound? Brick arrangements?]
